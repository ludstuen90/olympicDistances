# olympicDistances

I created this project to learn to use the Google Maps API. I'm attempting to replecate a project created by 
the New York Times, which takes a list of 2016 Olympic Runner Gold Medal Winners, and allows users to see 
exactly how far these runners went if they were running in your neighborhood. 

This is a work in progress.
